# The Farmer Was Replaced — Save Snapshot (scripts only)

Just for a bit of fun...

A snapshot of the editable scripts I use with the Steam game [The Farmer Was Replaced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/). This repository contains only the in-game script files I edit — the game's runtime `_builtins_` and `save.json` are not included.

Note: although these files use Python-like syntax, they run in the game's own scripting environment and are not standard Python scripts.
